This is to document my journey in learning Data Structures & Algorithms in Java. What prompted this was the experience I had when I applied for the Amazon Technology Insight Day which was to take place in Cape Town on the 5th of September, 2025. This was a weeknd event that promised an internship for the following year. When I got an email from my university advertising this event it was during the June-July holidays. I was at home watching the club world cup and I just applied on a whim, because why not. I'm a first year student at the time and all I know are some IF's and how to populate an array, backed with a math foudation in sets and logic. Come month-end July I find out I've made the cut for the final assessment. As you might have guessed, the assessment was on algorithms. Two questions, two hours. It was at 10 in the evening after a study session. Two of my friends whom I trust with code were there to assist. Everyone was sweating. I knew then that I was still at the tip of the iceberg at this thing. I didn't make it to the event nor the internship, however, this journey is one of the steps to ensure that such opportunities do not pass me by in the future.

I am using a Chrome extension called LeetSync to automate the process of uploading my LeetCode attempts to Github.
