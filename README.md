This is to document my journey in learning Data Structures & Algorithms. What prompted this was the experience I had when I applied for the Amazon Technology Insight Day which was to take place in Cape Town on the 5th of September. This was a weeknd event that promised an internship for next year. When I got an from my school advertising this event it was during the June-July holidays. I was at home watching the club world cup and I just applied on a whim, because why not. Bare in mind I'm first year and all I know are some IF's and how to populate an array, backed with a math foudation in sets and logic. Come month-end July I find out I've made the cut for the final assessment. I could just smell the money at this point. As you might have guessed, the assessment was on algorithms. Two questions, two hours. It was at 10 in the evening after a study session. Two of my friends whom I trust with code were there to assist. Everyone was sweating. I knew then that I was still at the tip of the iceberg at this thing. I didn't make it to the event nor the internship, however, this journey is one of the steps to ensure that such opportunities do not pass me by.
